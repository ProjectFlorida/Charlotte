## Development
To contribute to the Charlotte framework or run unit tests, use the Charlotte framework project.
```
$ cd Charlotte
$ open Charlotte.xcworkspace
```

To add or modify and example integration, use the Examples project. Charlotte is included as a local development pod, so you will only need to run `pod install` when you add or remove files in the Charlotte framework.
